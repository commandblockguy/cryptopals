Work-in-progress solutions for
[the cryptopals crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com/).
Don't worry, it's -graphy, not -currency.

I'm missing challenges 1-5 since for some reason I decided to do all of them
in one file, deleting the previous challenge's code as soon as it was unneeded.
Turns out that I'm bad at estimating when stuff is unneeded, so from then on
I decided to save all of them.

Some of these may not actually run anymore, I wasn't particularly careful
about keeping older challenges up to date with changes in common.py.
